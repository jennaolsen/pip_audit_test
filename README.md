🔐 Security Scan Demo Repository

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end security scanning workflow using:

pip-audit to detect vulnerable Python dependencies

A custom SARIF converter GitHub Action

GitHub Advanced Security – Code Scanning for displaying findings

It is designed as a teaching and testing project to show how dependency vulnerabilities travel from a scan → SARIF → GitHub Security Alerts.

📁 Repository Structure

    .github/workflows/main.yml            # Security scanning workflow

    vulnerable-app/app.py              # Demo Python application

    vulnerable-app/requirements.txt    # Intentionally vulnerable dependencies

    vulnerable-app/uv.lock             # Lockfile used by pip-audit

    README.md                 # This documentation


The vulnerable-app/ folder contains a simple Python app whose only purpose is to generate vulnerability findings for educational use.

⚠️ Demo Vulnerabilities (Intentional)

The Python packages below are intentionally outdated so that pip-audit will detect issues.

Included Vulnerable Dependencies
Package	Version	Notes
idna	2.5	Known low-severity issues
certifi	2018.8.24	Outdated certificate bundle
Flask	1.0	Contains several moderate CVEs
Requests	2.22.0	Known medium issues
PyYAML	5.3	Historically contained RCE vulnerabilities
Django	2.1.0	Multiple high/critical CVEs in old branches
werkzeug	0.14.1	Outdated and vulnerable

These versions are explicitly chosen to produce findings when scanned, allowing you to see:

How pip-audit reports vulnerabilities

How your SARIF converter assigns severity levels

How GitHub displays them under Security → Code Scanning Alerts

🔄 How the Workflow Operates

The GitHub Actions workflow performs the following steps:

Install dependencies

Run pip-audit on the vulnerable-app folder

Produce pip-audit JSON output

Run the custom SARIF converter

Upload SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning

Display alerts inside Security → Code Scanning

This demonstrates a full round-trip from detection → transformation → reporting.
